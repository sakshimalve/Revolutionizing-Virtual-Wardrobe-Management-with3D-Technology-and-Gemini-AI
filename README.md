# Revolutionizing Virtual Wardrobe Management with 3D Technology and Gemini AI

This project introduces a smart and interactive solution for managing wardrobes virtually using 3D technology and Gemini AI. It is designed to make fashion decisions easier, smarter, and more personalized by understanding the user's physical features and style preferences. Users can explore outfits that match their skin tone, face shape, and dress style, while also visualizing them in 3D â€” all from the comfort of their screen.

## ðŸ‘— Project Overview

Our system helps users make better outfit choices by:

- **Choosing skin tone** for color suggestions that enhance appearance.
- **Selecting face shape** (oval, round, diamond, etc.) for personalized styling.
- **Picking dress type and style** (casual, formal, traditional, etc.).
- **Viewing outfits in 3D**, simulating a virtual try-on experience.
- **Getting AI-powered recommendations** using Gemini API.
- **Enjoying dark and light modes** for visual comfort.
